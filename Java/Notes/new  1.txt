What is fail-fast in java?
A fail-fast system is nothing but immediately report any failure that is likely to lead to failure. When a problem occurs, a fail-fast system fails immediately. In Java, we can find this behavior with iterators. Incase, you have called iterator on a collection object, and another thread tries to modify the collection object, then concurrent modification exception will be thrown. This is called fail-fast.

==================================
Java Array Sort descending?

Collections.sort(list ,Collections.reverseOrder());

with explicit comparator:

Collections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder(new Comparator()));

for an array

Arrays.sort(array, Collections.reverseOrder());
