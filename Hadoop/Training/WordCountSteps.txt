WordCount example reads text files and counts how often words occur. The input is text files and the output is text files, each line of which contains a word and the count of how often it occured, separated by a tab.

We will use the file "README.txt" under hadoop installation folder for this example

Steps

1. Start your Hadoop cluster if it’s not running already.

	start-all.sh

2. Create a directory HadoopExamples under your home directory and change to it. This will store the compiled code and the jar files

	mkdir HadoopExamples

	cd HadoopExamples
	
3. Copy the WordCount.java to HadoopExamples directory	
	
4. Compile the code and create a jar file

	mkdir WordCountClasses

	javac -classpath /home/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1/hadoop-core-1.2.1.jar -d WordCountClasses WordCount.java
	
	[Assuming hadoop is installed at the following location - /home/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1]
	
	jar -cvf WordCount.jar -C WordCountClasses/ .

5. Create an Input and Output folder in HDFS which will store the input and output files

	hadoop fs -mkdir /input
	hadoop fs -mkdir /output
	
6. Copy input file to hdfs

	hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /home/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1/README.txt /input
	
7. Execute the program

	hadoop jar /home/hadoop/HadoopExamples/WordCount.jar com.operasolutions.hadooptraining.WordCount /input/README.txt /output/out1
	
8. View the output
	
	hadoop fs -cat /output/out1/part-r-00000
