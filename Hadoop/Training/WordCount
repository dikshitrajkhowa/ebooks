WordCount example reads text files and counts how often words occur. The input is text files and the output is text files, each line of which contains a word and the count of how often it occured, separated by a tab.

Each mapper takes a line as input and breaks it into words. It then emits a key/value pair of the word and 1. Each reducer sums the counts for each word and emits a single key/value with the word and sum.

As an optimization, the reducer is also used as a combiner on the map outputs. This reduces the amount of data sent across the network by combining each word into a single record. 

Restart your Hadoop cluster if itâ€™s not running already.

hadoop@ubuntu:~$ start-all.sh

We will use the file "README.txt" under hadoop installation folder for this example


==================================================================

mkdir HadoopExamples

cd HadoopExamples

gedit WordCount.java

Copy the following code

***

Compile the code 

mkdir WordCountClasses

javac -classpath /home/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1/hadoop-core-1.2.1.jar -d WordCountClasses WordCount.java

[Assuming hadoop is installed at the following location - /home/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1]

jar -cvf WordCount.jar -C WordCountClasses/ .

hadoop fs -mkdir /input
hadoop fs -mkdir /output

hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /home/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1/README.txt /input

hadoop jar /home/hadoop/HadoopExamples/WordCount.jar com.operasolutions.hadooptraining.WordCount /input/README.txt /output/out1

hadoop fs -cat /output/out1/part-r-00000
