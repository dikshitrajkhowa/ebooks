1. Cannot determine embedded database driver class for database type NONE

Action:

If you want an embedded database please put a supported one on the classpath. If you have database settings to be loaded from a particular profile you may need to active it (no profiles are currently active).

This arises if you have put spring-jdbc related info in pom.xml
put @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class}) in the main class
or if you have db configured put details in app.properties file

-----------------
2. Configure Auto-Reload after Change in the Source Code

First, disable the Thymeleaf template caching in your application.properties settings file:

	src/main/resources/application.properties
	spring.thymeleaf.cache = false

Second, install Spring Boot Development Tools in your Maven configuration
