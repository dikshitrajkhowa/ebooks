=====================================

Get all keys

First, Telnet to your server:

telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
Next, list the items to get the slab ids:

stats items
STAT items:3:number 1
STAT items:3:age 498
STAT items:22:number 1
STAT items:22:age 498
END
The first number after ‘items’ is the slab id. Request a cache dump for each slab id, with a limit for the max number of keys to dump:

stats cachedump 3 100
ITEM views.decorators.cache.cache_header..cc7d9 [6 b; 1256056128 s]
END

stats cachedump 22 100
ITEM views.decorators.cache.cache_page..8427e [7736 b; 1256056128 s]
END


========================
How do I see if memcached is already running on my chosen port?

telnet localhost 11211
